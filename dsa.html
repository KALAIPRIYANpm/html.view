    <h2 style="color:blueviolet;"><b><u>What is Non-Linear Data Structure?</u></b></h2>
    <p align="right">
        <ul type="disc">
       <li>A non-linear data structure is another important type in which data elements are not arranged sequentially; mainly, <b>data elements are arranged in random order without forming a linear structure.
Data elements are present at the multilevel, for example, tree.</b></li>
<li>In trees, the data elements are arranged in the hierarchical form, whereas in graphs,<b> the data elements are arranged in random order</b> using the edges and vertex.
Multiple runs are required to traverse through all the elements completely.</li> <li>Traversing in a single run is impossible to traverse the whole data structure.
<b>Each element can have multiple paths to reach another element.</b></li>
<li>The data structure where data items are not organized sequentially is called a non-linear data structure. In other words, data elements of the non-linear data structure could be connected to more than one element to reflect a special relationship among them.</li>
    </p>
</ul>

    <h2 style="color:brown;"><b><u>Tree</u></b></h2>
    <p align="right">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>The tree is a non-linear data structure that is comprised of various nodes</b>.</li><li>The nodes in the tree data structure are arranged in hierarchical order.</li>
<li>It consists of a root node corresponding to its various child node, present at the next level.</li><li> The tree grows on a level basis, and root nodes have limited child nodes depending on the order of the tree.</li>
<li>For example, in the binary tree, the order of the root node is 2, which means it can have at most 2 children per node, not more than it.</li>
<li><b>The non-linear data structure cannot be implemented directly</b>, and it is implemented using the linear data structure like an array and linked list.</li>
<li>The tree itself is a very broad data structure and is divided into various categories like Binary tree, Binary search tree, AVL trees, Heap, max Heap, min-heap, etc.</li>
<li><b>All the types of trees mentioned above differ based on their properties.</b></li>
    </p>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:aqua;"><b><u>Graph</u></b></h2>
    <p align="right">
        <ul type="disc">
            
                <li><b>A graph is a non-linear data structure with a finite number of vertices and edges, and these edges are used to connect the vertices.</b></li>
<li>The graph itself is categorized based on some properties; if we talk about a complete graph, it consists of the vertex set, and each vertex is connected to the other vertexes having an edge between them.</li>
<li>The vertices store the data elements, while the edges represent the relationship between the vertices.</li>
<li><b>A graph is very important in various fields; the network system is represented using the graph theory and its principles in computer networks.</b></li>
<li>Even in Maps, we consider every location a vertex, and the path derived between two locations is considered edges.</li>
        <li>graph representation's main motive is to find the minimum distance between two vertexes via a minimum edge weight.</li></ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

<h2 style="color:fuchsia;"><b><u>Properties of Non-Linear Data Structure</u></b></h2>
     <p align="right">
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>It is used to store the data elements combined whenever they are not present in the contiguous memory locations.</b></li>
                <li>It is an efficient way of organizing and properly holding the data.</li>
                <li>It reduces the wastage of memory space by providing sufficient memory to every data element.</li>
                <li>Unlike in an array, we have to define the size of the array, and subsequent memory space is allocated to that array; if we don't want to store the elements till the range of the array, then the remaining memory gets wasted.</li>
                <li>So to overcome this factor, we will use the non-linear data structure and have multiple options to traverse from one node to another.</li>
                <li><b>Data is stored randomly in memory.</b></li>
                <li><b>It is comparatively difficult to implement.</b></li>
                <li>Multiple levels are involved.</li>
                <li>Memory utilization is effective.</li>
        </ul>
